bio: Dave Cook is a data science, GEOINT and AI/ML practitioner in Washington,
  DC. He is passionate about the transformational power of AI/ML in GEOINT and
  MULTI-INT, particularly in building operational standards and best practices
  for data pipelining and readiness. Over his 25+ year career in the public and
  private sector, Dave has focused on solving complex challenges in law
  enforcement, intelligence, defense, health and across leading corporations
