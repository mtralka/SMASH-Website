name: Mengyu Liao
role: PhD Student; Member
priority: 3
bio: My interests include spatiotemporal theories and applications, big data,
  spatial data science, as well as geospatial modeling with machine learning. As
  a Ph.D student, I am eager to use those above to explore how humans perceive,
  interact with, and change space/environments. Particularly, I have a strong
  interest in bridging geospatial modeling with criminology, human mobility and
  health.
