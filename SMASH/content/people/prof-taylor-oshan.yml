priority: 1
bio: I am broadly interested in characterizing spatial patterns and processes
  through the use of quantitative geographic methods, which typically falls
  under the banners of spatial analysis and spatial statistics, geographic
  information science, and the emerging discipline of spatial data
  science. Overall, my research has targeted the development of multivariate
  spatial statistics and how they can be used to capture how relationships
  change by spatial and temporal contexts. This includes issues of theory,
  interpretation, scalability, and integration of traditional geographic models
  with novel "big" datasets, as well as applications in public health, crime,
  urban mobility, and transportation systems.
