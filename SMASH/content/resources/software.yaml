  The SMASH team regularly produces and maintains open source software and
  tools. Below you will find some information about products that are currently
  available.  
    

  ## PySAL Packages


  The Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL) is a federation of packages for handling, exploring, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data. For more info, check out the [project web page](https://pysal.org/) and [this paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gean.12276).


  ### mgwr


  The **mgwr** package provides an API for geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR). [Code can be found here](https://github.com/pysal/mgwr) and a [practical tutorial here](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/6/269/htm). Colleagues from SPARC at Arizona State University also maintain a point-and-click [graphic user interface](https://sgsup.asu.edu/sparc/multiscale-gwr) built on top of **mgwr**.


  ### spint


  The **spint** package provides an API for the calibration of ***sp***atial ***int***eraction models. [Code can be found here](https://github.com/pysal/spint) and a [practical tutorial here](https://openjournals.wu.ac.at/region/paper_175_revised/175.html).


  ### spglm


  The sparse generalized linear models (**spglm**) package provides an API for generalized linear models that are optimized for sparse design matrices with many zero values. [Code can be found here](https://github.com/pysal/spglm).


  ## SIDA Dashboard


  The spatial interaction decision analytics (SIDA) dasboard is prototype of a web-based visualization tool built by our own Matthew Tralka and with assistance from Tyler Hoffman. As a proof-of-concept, it was built entirely using a [reproducible environment](https://github.com/GEOSMASH/SIDA) that can be [deployed to the web](https://www.sida-board.app/) or used locally.
